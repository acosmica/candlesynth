# Time Travel Camera with Sound Synthesis

## Description

This is a p5.js project that creates a unique visual and auditory experience by combining a time-travel camera effect with sound synthesis. The project captures past frames from the camera and uses them to create a layered visual effect. It also generates sounds based on the position of drawn circles, creating an interactive soundscape.

## Instructions

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you have Python installed, you can start a simple HTTP server to serve the project. For Python 3, use `python3 -m http.server`. For Python 2, use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Features

- Time-travel camera effect that layers past frames to create a unique visual experience.
- Sound synthesis that generates sounds based on the position of drawn circles.
- Interactive design that allows the user to control the soundscape by drawing circles.

## Future Improvements

- Add more control over the time-travel effect, such as the ability to adjust the number of past frames that are displayed.
- Improve the sound synthesis to create a wider variety of sounds.
- Enhance the user interface to make it more intuitive and easier to use.
